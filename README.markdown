# Pure CSS SVG Countdown (Ready)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/suez/pen/dXbBGp](https://codepen.io/suez/pen/dXbBGp).

Based on this amazing dribbble shot - https://dribbble.com/shots/2604815-Ready

Originally I wanted to recreate all effects. But every time when I was leaving this demo for more than few days, I was coming back and swearing a lot, because working with multiple keyframes animations combined with svg-css path animations is SO INCREDIBLY PAINFUL.

Svg of course is handwritten, it was probably the funniest part (as always). And you can add additional color blocks and colors, if 3 is not enough for you.
